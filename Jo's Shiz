#I'm using bash...

#Used sed to remove NaN values, -999 values and the extra commas:
sed '/NaN/d' data.txt > data1.txt
sed '/-999/d' data1.txt > data2.txt
sed 's/,,/,/g' data2.txt > data3.txt

#I had to create a new file at each stage...for some reason, the changes weren't being applied otherwise.

#Used awk to print the mean and standard deviation...
awk '{sum += $1} END {print "AVG=",sum/NR}' data3.txt
awk '{sum+=$1; sumsq+=$1*$1} END {print sqrt(sumsq/NR - (sum/NR)**2)}' data3.txt

#Histograms..I've already spent around 1000 years doing the above, so will do this after the meeting!
