# Challenge-Week-1!

For our first week we're gonna be doing some basic data file manipulation! 

I've provided a data file with three columns of values, which we're gonna pretend are sugar concentrations in apples, oranges and a control. 

Unfortunately your equipment is a bit dodgy and you're gonna have to do some data cleaning before we can begin! 

Tasks1: clean data. 

Your csv file contains a few NaN values, values at -999 (can't have negative sugar concentration!) and a few extra commas. Clean it up! What's the best way to deal with these values? 

Tasks2: Basic stats 

Calculate the mean and SD of your data

Task 3: graph it up! 

Draw a histogram (or series of histograms) of your data. What's the best way to visualise this in your language?

Happy Coding!
